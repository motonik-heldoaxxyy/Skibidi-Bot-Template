# My Python Discord Bot

This Python script runs a Discord bot that performs various automated tasks on your server. Follow the steps below to clone the repository, configure your bot token, and run the script in your environment (Replit or Termux).

## Features

- **Discord bot** open sourced.
- **Easy configuration** to add your Discord bot token and run the script.
- **Runs on Replit or Termux**.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6 or higher**.
- **Discord bot token** (explained below).
- Python libraries:
  - `discord.py` (for Discord bot interaction)
  - Any other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (if present).

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

#### **Using Replit**:
1. Go to [Replit](https://replit.com/).
2. Create a new Python project.
3. In the project dashboard, click the "Git" icon or use the "Import from GitHub" option.
4. Paste the URL of your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/motonik-heldoaxxyy/Skibidi-Bot-source-code-I-guess
5. Replit will clone the repository into your workspace.


#### **Using Termux**:
1. Open Termux on your Android device, or download from this [linl]().
2. Install Git if you haven't already by running:
   ```bash
   pkg install git
3. Clone the repository by running:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/motonik-heldoaxxyy/Skibidi-Bot-source-code-I-guess
4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Skibidi-Bot-source-code-I-guess

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
#### **In Replit**:
Replit will automatically install dependencies listed in requirements.txt when you run the script. 
Just make sure requirements.txt exists in your project.


#### **In Termux**:
1. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. If requirements.txt does not exist, manually install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install discord.py



### Step 3: Add Your Discord Bot Token to SourceCode.py
To use the Discord bot, you need to provide your bot token in the script.

1. Open the SourceCode.py file.
2. Locate line 20 in the script:
   ```bash
   TOKEN = ""
3. Replace '' with your actual Discord bot token.



### Step 4: How to Get Your Discord Bot Token
Follow these steps to obtain your Discord bot token:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Log in with your Discord account.
3. Click on "New Application" (if you don’t have a bot already).
4. Name your application and click "Create".
5. In the left sidebar, click on Bot.
6. Click the Add Bot button, and confirm by clicking "Yes, do it!".
7. Under the Token section, click Copy to get your bot's token.
> Important: Do not share your bot token with anyone, as it gives full control of the bot.



### Step 5: Run the Script

#### **On Replit**:
1. After adding your bot token to SourceCode.py, click the green "Run" button in Replit to start the bot.

#### **On Termux**:
1. Open Termux and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the following command to execute the script:
   ```bash
   python3 SourceCode.py



### Step 6: Troubleshooting
Common Issues:

1. Invalid Token:
If you get an authentication error, ensure the token you entered is correct (make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes around it).

2. Missing Dependencies:
If the script fails due to missing libraries, ensure all required libraries are installed. You can install missing libraries with:
   ```bash
   pip install discord.py

3. Bot Permissions:
Ensure the bot has the correct permissions in the Discord server. Check the bot’s permissions in the server settings to ensure it can perform the required actions.

4. Replit Auto-Install Not Working:
If dependencies aren't automatically installed in Replit, you can manually install them using the shell in the Replit console:
   ```bash
   pip install discord.py
